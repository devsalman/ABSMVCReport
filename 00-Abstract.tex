\\ As time goes by, the complexity of software requirement is increasing because of the broad of problem domain which has to be solved by the software. This phenomenon requires the software to continue to evolve to fulfill the user needs. One of approach that we can use to keep the software evolving along with the user needs is using Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE). To implement this SPLE approach, we are using Abstract Behavioural Specification (ABS) as a tool. In this research we are building a framework for ABS which can be used to make a web-based software product line (SPL) using Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern and delta modelling approach.
